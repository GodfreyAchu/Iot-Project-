# Iot-Project-
 This IoT-based room vacancy detection system uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure object distance and a PIR sensor to detect human presence. LEDs provide visual indicators—green for vacancy, red for occupancy—while a buzzer alerts when an object is close. The system efficiently monitors room occupancy with real-time feedback
